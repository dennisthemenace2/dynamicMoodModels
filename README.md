# Social integration model analysis

Code for the analysis presented in the paper.

For the analysis, you also have to install the modified R mco package. The modification allows to get the population in each iteration of the algorithm. This is used to create plots of the NSGA2 improvement during optimization and convergence.

The analysis is separated into two files. One the "studyDataAnalysis.R" contains the analysis of the study data and "simulationAnalysis.R" contains the simulation analysis. The provided data is only dummy data.
